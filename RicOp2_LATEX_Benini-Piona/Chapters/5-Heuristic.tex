\chapter{Heuristic Methods}
\label{chp:5-Heuristic}
%************************************************
As we have said, the WFCP belongs to the class of NP-Hard problems so, many times, when the number of nodes is too high, we canâ€™t obtain an optimal solution in a feasible time.
For this reason we have decided to implement some algorithms that, instead of solving the mathematical model, use heuristic methods to find a solution of the problem. These methods can compute, relying on the characteristic structure of the problem, a good solution quickly but that is not guaranteed to be optimal.
Then, in the following section, we are going to describe some heuristic methods that iteratively execute a specific procedure trying to obtain consecutively a better solution.
